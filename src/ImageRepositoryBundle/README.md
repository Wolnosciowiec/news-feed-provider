Image Repository Bundle
=======================

Tiny bundle that integrates `news-feed-provider` service with a `file-repository` service
that offers hosting static images on your own servers.

Requires of course a `file-repository` server, if you don't have one you can set up
very easy on a VPS server or even ona a shared hosting as `file-repository` is LOW BUDGET.
